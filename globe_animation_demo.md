# 🌍 Spinning Globe Animation Demo

The spinning globe animation is now implemented in Ghost SSH Manager!

## Animation Sequence
The globe rotates through these characters every ~500ms:
```
🌍 → 🌎 → 🌏 → 🌍 → 🌎 → 🌏 (repeat)
```

## Where You'll See It

### 1. **Header Bar** 
```
👻 GHOST SSH Manager 🌍 [2/3 online | 1 sessions]
```
The globe spins continuously next to the status information.

### 2. **Connecting Popup**
```
┌─ Connecting... ─────────────┐
│                             │
│   🌍 → Connecting to srv01  │
│                             │
│   Press Esc to cancel       │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

### 3. **Server List** 
```
1: 🌍 🛡 Production Server    [1]
2: ●  🛡 Development Box      
3: 🌎 🛡 Database Primary     
```
Servers with "Connecting" status show the spinning globe instead of the static dot.

### 4. **Status Line with Active Connections**
```
👻 GHOST SSH Manager 🌏 [2/3 online | 1 sessions | 🌍 1 connecting]
```
When servers are actively connecting, shows globe + count in status.

## Technical Details

- **Animation Speed**: Updates every tick (~100ms), frame changes every 6 ticks (~600ms)
- **Colors**: Globe appears in blue (`TokyoNight::BLUE`) for visual appeal
- **State**: Tracked in `AppState.globe_animation_frame` (0-5, cycles through 3 globe chars)
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead, just a modulo operation per frame

## Cool Factor 🚀

The spinning globe gives Ghost a dynamic, "connecting across the world" feel that makes SSH connections feel more engaging and visually represents the global nature of server connections!

Try connecting to a server and watch the globe spin in multiple locations simultaneously.
