# ◐ Globe Animation Improvements

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. **Animation Speed** - Now Much Slower
- **Before**: Changed every tick (~100ms) - way too fast! 
- **After**: Changes every 20 ticks (~2 seconds) - nice smooth rotation
- **Implementation**: `(frame / 20) % 4` instead of `frame % 3`

### 2. **Monochrome Design** - Clean and Professional
- **Before**: Colorful emoji globes 🌍🌎🌏 in blue
- **After**: Monochrome spinning circles ◐◓◑◒ in default text color
- **Benefits**: 
  - Works on all terminals/fonts
  - More professional appearance
  - Better accessibility
  - Fits the terminal aesthetic

### 3. **Debug Message Cleanup** - No More Screen Clutter
Removed all debug `eprintln!` statements:
- ~~🔢 DEBUG: Quick connect to server~~
- ~~🔑 DEBUG: Enter key pressed!~~
- ~~📶 DEBUG: App connect_to_server called~~
- ~~💪 DEBUG: About to call health_monitor~~
- ~~🔄 DEBUG: Session PID has ended~~
- ~~🔫 DEBUG: Attempting to kill session~~
- ~~✅ DEBUG: Successfully killed PID~~

## New Animation Sequence

```
◐ → ◓ → ◑ → ◒ → (repeat every ~8 seconds)
```

Each character shows for ~2 seconds, creating a smooth rotating effect.

## Where You'll See It

1. **Header**: `👻 GHOST SSH Manager ◐ [2/3 online]`
2. **Connecting Popup**: `◓ → Connecting to server...`  
3. **Server List**: `1: ◑ 🛡 Production Server` (when connecting)
4. **Status Line**: `[2/3 online | ◒ 1 connecting]`

## Technical Details

- **Frame Rate**: 80-frame cycle (each character shows for 20 frames)
- **Timing**: ~2 seconds per character at default tick rate
- **Characters**: Unicode circle quarters (U+25D0-U+25D3)
- **Color**: Default foreground text color (monochrome)
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead, single modulo operation

The globe now provides a subtle, professional indication of connecting activity without being distracting or too flashy!
